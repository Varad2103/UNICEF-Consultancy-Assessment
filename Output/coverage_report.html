    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
The bar plot compares the weighted coverage of ANC4 and SBA indicators between on-track and off-track countries. 
On-track countries show slightly lower coverage than off-track countries for both indicators, possibly reflecting 
that countries initially off-track may have received more focused intervention efforts. However, this interpretation 
assumes accurate and consistent reporting of coverage and projected birth data. Any gaps in data quality or completeness 
may affect the reliability of the comparison.
